# Customer Segmentation: Data Cleaning & Exploration

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **data cleaning and exploration** phase of a customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. The goal is to prepare the dataset for clustering by identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, and to gain insights through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Provide your dataset link here]  
- **Key Columns:**
  - `CustomerID` – Unique identifier for each customer  
  - `Recency` – Days since last purchase  
  - `Frequency` – Number of purchases  
  - `Monetary` – Total spending  

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset’s structure, column types, and basic statistics.  
3. **Missing Value Handling**: Detect and manage missing values through deletion or imputation.  
4. **Duplicate Handling**: Identify and remove duplicate records.  
5. **Outlier Detection**: Visualize and analyze outliers using boxplots.  
6. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute average purchase value, frequency, and recency.  
7. **Visualization**: Generate histograms, pair plots, and scatter plots to explore data distributions and relationships.  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-link>
2. Open the notebook 1_data_cleaning.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter.

3. Upload the dataset into the data/ folder (if not already included).

4. Run all cells sequentially to perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations.
